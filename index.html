			William Shaespear's <em>Sonnets</em> consits of 154 poems, each fourteen
			lines long (three
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain">quatrains</a>
			followed by a rhyming
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>).
			<strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and it begins like this:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
				Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
				Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
				And summer's lease ath all too short a date.
			</p>
